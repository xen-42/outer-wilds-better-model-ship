Mica's brand new prototype model ship.

Features:
- Adds a camera to the model ship so you can see where you're going
- Makes the roll controls the same as the real ship
- Adds a flashlight to the model ship

Roadmap:
- Allow using the signalscope

- See ghost matter
- Allow interacting with any prompts
- Add translator
- Allow switching between the probe and the player without recalling it
- Literally beat the entire game as a model ship
